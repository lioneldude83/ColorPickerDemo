# ColorPickerDemo

## Example of how to include png/mp4 links in md file for GitHub

A SwiftUI demo showing how to use ColorPicker and persist the chosen color in UserDefaults using AppStorage.

## Features

    â€¢ SwiftUI ColorPicker integrated into a simple demo view.
    â€¢ Selected color is stored as a hex string in AppStorage.
    â€¢ Colors persist across app launches.
    â€¢ Conversion between Color â†” Hex String with a helper extension.
    â€¢ Option to disable opacity if you only want solid colors.

## Setup

    1. Download ColorPickerView.swift from this repo.
    2. Create a new SwiftUI project in Xcode.
    3. Add ColorPickerView.swift to your project.
    4. Run the app on the simulator or device.

## Storing Color in UserDefaults

Since UserDefaults only supports basic types (Int, String, etc.), we convert the selected color into a hex string before saving.

    â€¢ Example: #FF0000FF â†’ Red with full opacity.
    â€¢ The stored string is restored back to a Color on app launch.

This is handled with the included Color extension.

## Example Code

            // supportsOpacity is optional, defaults to true
            ColorPicker("Select a Color", selection: $selectedColor, supportsOpacity: true)
            
            // Use onChange to react to changes in the color picker
            .onChange(of: selectedColor) { _, newColor in
                colorHex = newColor.hexString
            }
